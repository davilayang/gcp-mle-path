- Machine learning is about scaling beyond handwritten rules.

- You might be thinking of ML as a way to do the things in the middle, of being able to take the data you happen to have and train the ML model, but think of ML as a way to get to kind of the things on the right, of being able to personalize your services for each of your customers. 
- An ML strategy is first and foremost a data strategy. 
- In short, if you can't do analytics, you can't do ML.
