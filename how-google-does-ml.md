## 10 Common Pitfalls

> https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_sessions/1577813/video/320602

- ML requires just as much software infrastructure
  - comparing to API and other know software services
- No data collected
- Assume the data is ready to use (maybe not)
- Keep humans in the loop (every system needs this)
- Product launch focuses on the ML algorithm
- ML optimizing for the wrong thing
  - always want to look out for perverse incentives
- Is your ML improving things in the real world
- Using a pre-trained ML algorithm vs building your own
- ML algorithms are trained more than once
- Trying to design your own NLP algorithm
