# Notes on "Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals"

## Thoughts

- Use BigQueryML in works? Some kind of recommendations? 
- Problem Framing, 

- BigQuery ML supports modeling training, is there something we could use with "recommendation" or with ideas from reforge?
- define business problems, i should have better ideas about what our problem is before getting into modelling  or others
  - then, next would be to evaluate and improve model results
  - so, what is the real problem with our recommendation stuff?
- examples to apply machine learning capability, (within our context)
- this is creative work: linking what I know (with ML) to what the company needs 
  - something I find intersting
